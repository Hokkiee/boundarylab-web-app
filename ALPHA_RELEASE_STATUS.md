## 🚨 **CRITICAL NEXT STEPS**

### 1. **Supabase Configuration (MUST DO FIRST)**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Update Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Set Site URL: https://www.boundarylab.co
3. Add Redirect URL: https://www.boundarylab.co/auth/callback
4. Save changes
```

### 2. **OAuth Testing Sequence**
1. Test `oauth-test.html` first (isolated test)
2. Test development server OAuth flow
3. Test production build OAuth flow
4. Verify end-to-end user experience

### 3. **Announcement System Testing**
1. Run SQL schema: `database/announcements-schema.sql`
2. Test admin announcement creation
3. Test user announcement viewing
4. Test filtering and search functionality

## 🎯 **TESTING PRIORITY**

### High Priority
1. **OAuth Flow** - Critical for user onboarding
2. **Announcement System** - New feature for communication
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Essential for user experience

### Medium Priority
1. **Forum functionality** - Core feature testing
2. **Profile system** - User data management
3. **Notification system** - User engagement

### Low Priority
1. **Admin features** - Can be refined post-launch
2. **Advanced settings** - Nice-to-have features
3. **Analytics** - Post-launch optimization

## 📋 **Ready for Testing**

The app is now ready for comprehensive testing. All major systems are implemented and the build is successful. The main blocker is the Supabase configuration update.

## 🚀 **Post-OAuth Fix**

Once OAuth is working:
1. Complete the ALPHA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
2. Test all major user flows
3. Deploy to production domain
4. Monitor for issues and user feedback

## 🔧 **Development Status**

- **Development Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:3002
- **Production Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Preview Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:4174
- **OAuth Configuration**: ⚠️ Needs Supabase update
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Ready for deployment
- **UI Components**: ✅ All implemented
- **API Services**: ✅ All functional

The app is technically ready for alpha release pending the OAuth configuration fix.
